## Acknowledgments

Thanks a lot to TingHueiChen's CodePen, otherwise I wouldn't have completed this challenge. I have absolutely no idea using radio as a button for the rating. 
Previously I was scratching my head on how to apply the overlay background on my button until I found out about `hsla` and using `radio` as an option. I've tried referring to Bootstrap's documentation about button's resizing but fail.

I have copy pasted some of the code and did not remove some but marked as a comment there.
