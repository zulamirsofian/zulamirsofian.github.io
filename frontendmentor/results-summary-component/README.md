## Acknowledgments

I understand that my code is really messy and there are a lot of improvements needed to be made. I believe this is one of the rewarding challenges I have completed as of today because I used vw, vh and % for measurement units. Understanding how the units should be used. By no means I did it perfectly as I've applied it on padding and border-radius.
