## Acknowledgments

Thanks a lot to tsbankara's video, I remember watching the whole video before doing it and I left this challenge a week. After that, I picked up the pace and I picked up some of the codes and explanations he wrote and read some documentations about grid and I did Froggy Flexbox during my free time for this challenge as well. Was pretty happy to complete this challenge as I completed without using Bootstrap
